- Angular structure
	- Package.json = dependancies
	- Package-lock.json = dependencies for production
	- Angular.json = configuration, selectors, environments, url api
	- Starts application at main.ts
	- Things that start with @ are in the node_modules folder (angular library)
	- Content in ts files
		- "Metadata decorators"
		- Selectors are references in index.html
		- Standalone: component does not need to be in an angular module
	- Models/index.ts
		- Basically objects
- Creating components
	- `ng generate component NAME` or `ng g c NAME`
		- Creates folder called NAME
		- Creates css, html, and ts file
		- Can write name of new component as folderName/componentName
	- `--inline-template` and `--inline-style`
		- Does not create separate html or css file
	- `--flat`
		- Does not create new folder
	- `--dry-run`
		- Does not generate files at all
		- Shows you what files it WOULD generate
- Angular Component info
	- Can declare variables in ts file to be exported
		- These can be used in html file by enclosing in double curly braces
	- Can use methods in html within double curly braces
		- Ex: {{ title.toUpperCase() }}
		- Ex: {{ 2 + 2 }}
	- Can use for loop in html
		- Ex: <li \*ngFor="let friend of friends">{{friend}}
		- Have to import CommonModule, NgFor in ts file
	- Can create functions in ts file to be used in html file
	- Can use if statements in html (\*ngIf)
	- Can send info to parent component
		- @Output() functionName = new EventEmitter\<type>()
		- Can then use functionName.emit(item)
		- Then create function in parent, call within tag of child component
		- (varName) = "parentFunc($event)"
	- Don't put logic in the components
		- Make components as dumb as possible
- Easy HTML: emmet.io
- Continuous Integration
	- Have to construct code in a way that small pieces can easily come together
	- Part of DevOps (will discuss more later)
	- Several developers contribute to origin repo or "single point of truth"
	- Push code EVERY DAY at least once
	- Must commit WORKING code even if its not in production
	- CI Pipeline
		- Builds code
		- Unit tests, component tests, security tests, compliance tests
		- Goes to delivery/deployment afterwards
- VS Code settings
	- Change in settings.json
	- Settings we changed
		- "explorer.compactFolders": false
		- "workbench.tree.indent": 14
		- "editor.formatOnSave": true
	- Prettier
		- Extention for VS code
		- `Alt + Shift + F` and hit configure
- Cypress
	- In package.json: "component-test": "cypress open"
		- `npm run component-test`
	- Allows for testing of individual components
	- Need to build testing files (ending in .cy.ts)
	- Description is the name of the test section
	- it('Should do this') is the name of individual tests
- Best to ADD new stuff without CHANGING existing things
- Testing
	- Developer testing
		- Often have to write tests for code that doesn't exist yet
		- Use tests to verify the code we are writing as we go
- Feedback loops
	- Inner loop = everything that happens on your machine during development
	- Outer loop = everything after that (when you push code to the repo, etc)
