- Linux
	- Kernal
		- "Inner ring" part of linux
		- Has access to the processor, memory, hardware (disk, etc)
	- Containers
		- Run on top of the kernal
		- Where most code runs
		- Ubuntu, Pop_os, NixOs, etc
	- Microsoft ships a linux kernal
		- Containers can ONLY run on Linux
		- Mac requires a virtualization tool, Microsoft shops a Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Git vs. Github
	- Centralized version control = some server owns the code
	- Distributed version control
		- anarchy, each dev has a copy of the code
		- One authoritative copy ("origin")
		- Everyone can push and pull code, can work on code without the server
	- Git is this distributed version control
	- Github is a website, a place to store "origin"
	- Github is the site, git is the tool, Github uses git
	- Azure DevOps is Microsoft's version of Github, basically
- Angular Components vs. Pages
	- They are all components, just a naming convention
	- Components have selectors
	- Pages are containers for other components, usually created by visiting a route
- Cluster
	- Multiple computers that run as one
	- Where most of the Progressive stuff runs
	- Usually something outside of the cluster makes it run
		- User interface applications
		- Native app (iOS, android), web applications, angular applications, etc
		- Can be internal or external (handled through authentication + authorization)
	- Inside the cluster
		- Content server (can do GET requests to the content server)
		- Services
	- Drives (Uses)
		- Ex: databases
		- Can remote procedure call (RPC) from inside the cluster to outside
- API creation
	- Controllers
		- Must be a public class
		- Must extend Controller or ControllerBase
		- Can create methods for GET, POST, etc
	- Settings
		- make changes in "Profiles"
		- Only changes what happens in development
		- Launch URL is swagger, which reads the documentation and displays with UI
	- GET Request with controller
		- Creates an instance of the controller, and calls the GET method
		- Every request duplicates this process, creates a new instance of the controller
		- .NET APIs, can handle X number of simultaneous requests at the same time
	- Refactoring
		- Can't change or remove things, will break other peoples code
		- Response has to be a number,  a string, a boolean, null, an object, or  an array
			- Can only be ONE of these
			- Almost always return an object
		- Can add things to the API
- Visual Studio - Comment Multiple lines
	- Comment - `Ctrl + K -> Ctrl + C`
	- Uncomment - `Ctrl + K -> Ctrl + U`
- Kinds of Databases
	- Relational
		- store data in rows and columns (relations)
		- SQL server, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, etc
			- SQL = "Structured Query Language"
	- Object
		- Store object graphs
		- MongoDB (stores JSON as BSON)
	- Key Value
		- Usually just store configuration stuff or cached values
		- Redis
	- Graph
		- Kinda like object databases but different (dw about it)
- Containers solve 2 big problems
	- Dev/Prod Parity (works on my machine, needs to work everywhere)
	- Sharing a server (resources, writing to disk paths, tcp ports)
		- Linux Kernel has namespaces which allocate everything a code needs on the server
- HTTP status codes
	- 200-299 = this worked
	- 300-399 = need more information
	- 400-499 = they suck (the user of the api)
	- 500-599 = we suck (did something wrong)
- Even if you validate something in the angular app, you have to validate it in the API
	- Never trust the client
- Concurrency
	- Threads! We're talking about threads and how they run on cores and whatnot!
	- Thread starts a process and does something else
	- End of the process calls a thread to come back when its done
	- I/O Bound Operations
		- Database calls, calling other apis, reading and writing to files
	- In API
		- Controllers are async, return a task
		- Await means do not continue until the called method returns
	- Use for blocking calls
- Run code in Visual Studio: `ctrl + f5`
