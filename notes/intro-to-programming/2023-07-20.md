- Be fast and limit liability
- Object Oriented Programming
	- Procedural Programming
		- Decisions, loops, variables, etc
		- Requires programmer to keep everything in their mind
	- SAABRE - Flight Reservation and Tracking
	- Every program is state and behavior
		- State = data
		- Behavior = code that works on that data
		- OOP says when possible, relate those things together in a kind of capsule
	- Cohesion
		- Making sure behaviors of a type are related to the data of that type
		- Ex: string in .NET knows how to do string stuff
	- .NET types
		- Only two kinds of types: values and references
		- Values
			- Ex: numbers (int, double, etc), DateTime
			- Can create new values usinga  struct
			- Live on the stack
		- References
			- Live on the heap
			- Created with classes and records
	- Classes
		- Define the two things an object can have: state and behavior
		- State is class level variables or fields, usually private
		- Behavior allows the user to interact with the state, usually public
- Generating .NET classes
	- Need separate testing and library classes
	- Create class
		- Use class constructor in test
		- `Ctrl + .` and generate class to choose options
	- Create class methods
		- Use method in test
		- `Ctrl + .` to generate method in given class
		- MUST have a real return type to generate this way (not just var)
	- Class Level Variables
		- Should start with underscore (ex: \_balance)
		- Should be private
- Format in Visual Studio: `Ctrl + K -> Ctrl + D`
- Storage (for .NET)
	- Stack
		- Stores name, type, and value
		- Value of structs is stored on the stack (they are simple)
	- Managed Heap
		- Objects are stored on the heap, space is allocated for them
		- Objects on the heap get an object identifier
		- Identifiers are stored as the value of objects on the stack
- Function Purity
	- Pure functions will always return the same output given an input
	- Impure functions have some other confounding outside variable
- Must set a project as startup project in Visual Studio if the solution has multiple
- Building good interface is about making complicated stuff look easy
- Creating Helper Methods
	- Create the functionality in the larger method first
	- Highlight, click screwdriver/lightbulb, then extract method
	- Can also encapsulate code in snippets easily with right click (ex: try/catch)
- Can override virtual methods in a child class
	- Child class marks methods as override
	- Parent class marks methods as virtual to allow this
- C# is a statically typed language - variable cannot change its data type
- Prefer composition over inheritance
