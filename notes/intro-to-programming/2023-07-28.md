- Containers
	- Only a Linux thing
	- Have to run on a machine that has a Linux kernel
	- You don't have to install all the software you need, can run stuff on a container
	- Docker Hub
		- Has several containers that can be pulled to your machine
		- In cmd: `docker images` gives a list of container images on your local machine
		- In cmd: `docker ps` gives a list of running containers on your machine
	- Terminology
		- Docker -  a company, brand name
		- Container - a running container image
		- Container Image - the layers on the hard drive that become a container when run
		- Layers - the files that contain the stuff your application needs
	- Containers have one more layer than images
	- Layers (bottom to top)
		- Base Layer (FROM)
		- .NET 7 Runtime 
		- NuGet packages
		- Compiled Application
		- FOR CONTAINERS ONLY: Read/Write layer
			- All other layers become readonly in a container
			- Ephemeral - comes and goes, cannot be relied on
	- Layers Explanation
		- The things most likely to change are at the top
		- Deploying a new version only downloads the changed layers
		- Goal is to send the least amount to production as possible
	- Dockerfile
		- First thing is the base layer is specified
		- Run with `docker build`
			- Needs one argument
			- We used file path `.`
			- Can use `-t repository-name:tag`
		- Run with `docker run repository-name:tag`
