- Visual Studio
	- Will always clone a repository, open a project, or create a new project
		- Will likely not open a folder
	- Solution vs. Project
		- Solution is a container for one or more projects
		- Project is what gets compiled to an assembly
		- Do not need to have the same name
	- Keyboard shortcuts
		- Save, build, run: `ctrl + f5`
		- Run with debugger: `f5`
		- Fix error: `Ctrl + .` (same as VS Code)
		- Console.WriteLine(): `cw -> tab`
		- Go to method definition: `f12`
	- View -> Other Windows -> C# Interactive
- .NET
	- Formatting
		- PascalCase - assembly, namespaces, classes, methods, properties, (public)
		- camelCase - local variable names
	- Support
		- LTS (Long Term Support) - 3 years - even # versions
		- STS (Standard Term Support) - 18 months - odd # versions
		- Current LTS version is 6.0, will be 8.0 in September
	- We are using .NET 7.0 without top level statements
		- With top level statements, don't need the class names and whatnot
	- Starts running in `static void Main(string[] args) {}`
	- Implicit Using
		- Adds using System, etc
		- Just write `Console.WriteLine()` instead of `System.Console.WriteLine()`
	- Mostly used to create API
		- Can change to .Web in project file
- Postman
	- Used to test different requests
	- Switch to lightweight API
- HTTP File
	- Also used to test different requests 
	- Must have a comment (`###`) between requests
- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
	- A program that has to be installed on the machine for your .NET applications to run
	- Similar to JVM
	- Manages memory using garbage collection
	- For any language that compiles to CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
- Framework Class Library - FCL
	- All the .NET types that come in the box
	- Ex: System.Console
- Programmer Modes
	- Systems Programming
		- Creating OS, database engines, compilers, tools, etc
		- Assembler, C, C++, Rust
		- Priorities: reliability, performance
	- Library/Framework Programming
		- Library = code that your code uses
		- Framework = code that uses your code
		- Still need reliability (but more general)
	- Application Developers
		- Applying libraries, frameworks, systems to do business stuff
		- Focused on business requirements
		- Performance still important, but balance that with "intention revealing"
			- Another trained developer can read the code and understand the intention
- Four rules of simple design
	- Passes the tests (works right)
	- Reveals intention
	- No duplication
	- Fewest elements (variables, loops, if statements (cause bugs))
- Unit testing softwares
	- jUnit - for Java
	- nUnit - for .Net
	- MsTest - sucked at first but got better
	- xUnit - what we are using, most documentation uses this, used on .Net
- xUnit testing in Visual Studio
	- Can be [Fact] or [Theory]
		- Theory allows for multiple permutations
	- Can use [InlineData()] to give arguments to a following test
- Test First Development
	- A process or form for writing intentional code
	- Very difficult to write tests at the unit level after all code is finished
	- Red -> Green -> Refactor
		- In a loop
		- May have a commit between refactor and red
	- Red
		- Start with a meaningfully failing test
		- Fails on the assert, not throwing an exception
	- Green
		- Write the simplest code possible to get the test to pass
		- Don't worry about writing good code at this point
		- If it takes longer than a few minutes, delete the test and make smaller steps
	- Refactoring
		- Improving the design of existing code
		- Renaming things and removing duplication, mostly
		- Bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code
		- Don't add any new functionality
