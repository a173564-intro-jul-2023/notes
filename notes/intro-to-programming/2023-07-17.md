- Angular structure
	- Delete everything in template (app.component.html)
	- Variables (?) created in app.component.ts
- Github commands
	- Initialize empty repo = `git init`
	- Add files = `git add .`
	- Commit files = `git commit -m "message"`
	- Create repo in github = `gh repo create`
	- Mostly can do this in VS code GUI
- Angular is NOT for normal websites, for APPLICATIONS that run in browser
- Typescript
	- Compiles to javascript (so computer understands)
	- www.typescriptlang.org
	- Typing variables
		- let varName:type
		- TS will not allow you to change type of variable
	- Functions
		- Can indicate necessary properties
		- Ex: function doIt(something: {message: string}): alert(something.message)
- Component
	- Typescript class and a template
		- both are compiled and sent to browser
		- Template can be separate file or inline
	- Accurately projects application state
		- State = the value of all meaningful data NOW
	- Provides affordances through which the user can interact with the application
	- Every angular project has an AppComponent
		- Can have children (ex: HeaderComponent)
- Tailwind
	- CSS library
	- Has classes (ex: text-3xl)
	- DaisyUI
		- Themes (ex: synthwave, cyberpunk)
		- Can assign a theme in html tag
		- www.daisyui.com
- Routing
	- <router-outlet /> tag sets up the section where routing takes place
	- declare routes in app.routes.ts
	- Path and component
- Notes
	- Can add double square brackets or # on something to create a new page
	- Add, commit and push changes
