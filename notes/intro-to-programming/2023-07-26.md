- Using shared databases
	- Dapper is good for using existing databases
	- Entity Framework (Microsoft) - make the right thing the easiest thing to do
		- Similar to Marten in that it just makes the database structure for you
		- CAN work with existing/shared databases but its not worth it
	- Dapper is less cool but more adaptive to changes
- Distributed application
	- No one service is going to be all that useful
	- Need to make sure changing one thing doesn't break another
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
	- Services call into other services
	- Building apps is like putting together legos - you just put existing things together
	- API Gateway catalog
	- Heavily reliant on RPCs
	- Like a phone call, need to make a request and get a response immediately
		- Not asynchronous
- SLA = Service Level Agreement
	- Contract in terms of performance
- Microservices
	- More on asynchronous methods
	- Message queues / event sourcing / event streams
	- Less about the size of the service and more about the specificity
- SRE = Site Reliability Engine
- CORS = Cross origin resource sharing
- Environment
	- Production environment vs. development environment
	- Angular is compiled to html + javascript
	- Should not hardcode urls because they may change by environment
	- Run `ng generate environments`
	- In the ts file: `import {environment} from '../../../../environments/environment'`
- Debugging
	- Can't really debug Angular in VS Code, can debug in browser dev tools
	- Sources tab in dev tools, src folder, `ctrl + p` to search for a file
	- Can set breakpoints and step through
- HTTP-Based APIs
	- HTTP is a standard
	- The first page on the web ever: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
	- Resources (important things)
		- Identified by a URL
		- Server (whatever.com) is called the authority
	- Can support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (and some others)
		- GET - return a representation of this thing 
		- POST - please add this as a subordinate resource 
		- PUT - replace this resource with this new representation
		- DELETE - remove this resource
	- Requests can accept headers like Accept (asks for a certain kind of return)
	- Properties of HTTP Methods
		- Safe - no one cares, nothing about the "business" changes from this (no side effects)
			- GET is safe
		- Idempotent - doing it multiple times is the same as doing it once
			- GET, PUT, DELETE are idempotent
		- Cacheable - you can store something i think
			- GET is cacheable
	- Resources (URI), representation (the data sent to/from the API), methods
	- "Most API design issues are solved by adding a new resource"
	- Make structs nullable to ensure they are required in POSTs: `TypeName?`
