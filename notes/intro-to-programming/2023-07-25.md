- Semantic versioning
	- Versions are in three parts: major, minor, and patch
		- Ex: "karma": "~6.4.0"
	- Patch
		- Increment when there are backward compatible bug fixes
		- Nothing new here
		- Probably should stay on top of these
	- Minor
		- Includes backward compatible new features
		- Usually fine to update if you have good tests
	- Major
		- Contains at least one breaking change
		- Might not 
	- Version site: https://semver.npmjs.com/
	- Symbols
		- Come before the version number
		- ^ = accept any minor or patch changes when installing
		- ~ = accept just patch changes when installing
	- Package-lock.json locks specific versions as what should be used
- Flux Architecture
	- Developed by Facebook to deal with component interactions / state changes
	- Components own no data
	- All data is stored in a global immutable object (state)
	- There is only one place in your app that can create a new state
	- Dan Abramov created a library for flux architecture in React called Redux
	- Angular does Redux with @ngrx libraries
		- Website: https://ngrx.io/
		- Components in general
			- User interface is components
			- Take some data (state) and make it pretty
			- Accurately project the application state to the user
			- Provide affordances through which the user interacts with the application
		- For the state
			- Components select the state from the global store
		- For the interactions
			- Describe what happened as an Action and tell the store about it
- Properties (C#)
	- Private variables in a class (called backing fields)
	- Have getters and setters
		- Can be generated by the compiler
		- Ex: public int Letters { get; set; }
	- Can be used as varName.PropertyName
	- Should not throw exceptions
	- Should always return the same thing (given the same input)
		- DateTime.Now is used as a property but technically it shouldn't be
	- Can do init instead of set
		- MUST be set in the initializer
	- .NET cannot compare reference types (objects)
		- Would have to implement IEquatable interface with Equals method
- Records (C#)
	- Pretty much the same as properties
	- Values shouldn't change (uses init, not set)
	- Automatically implements IEquatable
	- Can also just accept parameters in constructor
	- See - Jeff's C# Syntax
	- Updating values
		- Given: x property in var is wrong
		- newVar = var with x = newX;
- Changing states in Angular
	- Very similar to changing records in C#
	- Return a new state that is the old state with something changed
- Reactive Programming = interface reacts to the state
- Reducer
	- Actions go into reducer function
	- Reducer checks validity and/or creates new states
	- Pushes selector (with state info) back to component
	- Also exchanges data with effects class
- Effects
	- Takes in observable stream of Actions (after they are passed through reducer)
		- Stream names end with $
	- Must decorate the class as `@Injectable`
	- CreateEffect
		- Takes a function as an argument
		- Dispatch can be true or false
- CORS
	- Browser sends HTTP options request before sending get request
